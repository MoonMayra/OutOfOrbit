    dialogueLine: "It\u2019s you."
  - speakerName: 'Mia '
    dialogueLine: What are you doing here? How did you even get in?
  - speakerName: Mia
    dialogueLine: Listen to me. That gem is dangerous. You have to give it to me.
  - speakerName: 'Mia '
    dialogueLine: "Dangerous? It\u2019s the greatest discovery we\u2019ve ever made.
      Do you understand what this could mean for humanity?"
  - speakerName: Mia
    dialogueLine: "I do. More than you could think. Because I\u2019ve seen what it
      does. It\u2019s capable of destroying the whole Earth."
  - speakerName: 'Mia '
    dialogueLine: "T-that\u2019s impossible. I ran every test. The readings are stable."
  - speakerName: Mia
    dialogueLine: "That\u2019s what I thought too. Until it wasn\u2019t. You can\u2019t
      control it. You have to stop this experiment before it starts."
  - speakerName: 'Mia '
    dialogueLine: Who even are you to tell me what to do with my own creation?
  - speakerName: Mia
    dialogueLine: "I\u2019m you. From the future. I came back to make sure you never
      activate that thing. "
  - speakerName: 'Mia '
    dialogueLine: You expect me to believe that? That I- you, would ever cause something
      like that?
  - speakerName: Mia
    dialogueLine: "You already did. And I\u2019ve spent every day trying to fix it."
  - speakerName: Narrator
    dialogueLine: "You see her tighten her grip on the gem. It\u2019s light pulsing."
  - speakerName: 'Mia '
    dialogueLine: "No. I won\u2019t let you take this from me. You\u2019re just afraid.
      Afraid of what we can become. "
  - speakerName: Mia
    dialogueLine: "I\u2019m afraid of what we already became. "

    dialogueLine: The silence between you vibrates with the energy of the stone.
      The air hums, lights flickering as both of you lock eyes.
